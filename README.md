# CarPriceML ðŸš—ðŸ“ˆ  
Predicting car prices using machine learning models and insightful data analysis.

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Description**  
CarPriceML is a machine learning project designed to predict car prices based on various attributes like car make, model, mileage, year, and more. Leveraging the [Cooper Union Car Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset) and methodologies from the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp by DataTalks.Club](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/blob/master/02-regression/01-car-price-intro.md), this project provides a comprehensive pipeline for building and evaluating predictive models.

Through this project, we aim to:
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover factors influencing car prices.
2. Build and compare **regression models** for predicting car prices.
3. Deliver insights in a **reproducible** and well-documented format.
